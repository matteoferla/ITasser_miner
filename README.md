## T&C?
If you stumbled across this repo, please be aware that I do not know if it is within the T&Cs of I-Tasser.
I am not doing anything evil*, bar use up some of their bandwidth, so I think it's fine.              
(&lowast; I am not spying on certain protein or individuals, reselling information etc.)

## Questions

* Where to cut a protein?
* How much to submit?
* Is everyone hopeless, thus meaning that any consensus is wrong?
* How close to making a human model proteome?
* etc.
